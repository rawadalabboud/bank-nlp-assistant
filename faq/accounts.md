You can check your balance in the Online Customer Area or the mobile app. Balances are updated in real time.

# How do I open a bank account?
You can apply online or at a post office. Provide valid ID and proof of address. Once approved, you will receive your account details and card.

# What is the account balance?
The account balance shows the money available after processed transactions. Pending payments (checks, card operations) may not be visible immediately.

# How do I get a bank statement or RIB?
Log into your Online Area → Accounts → Download/Print RIB. In the app, use “Share RIB” or “Download RIB”.

# I’ve lost my login credentials — what do I do?
Use “Forgot username/password” on the login page. Temporary credentials are sent via SMS or post, then set a new password. If stolen, call support to block access.
