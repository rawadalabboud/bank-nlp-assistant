# How do I recognize a fraudulent email or message?
Fraudulent emails often contain urgent language, threats, spelling errors, or unofficial logos. Official emails come from @labanquepostale.fr. The bank will never ask for your login or PIN by email/SMS. If you get a suspicious email, do not click any links. Forward it to emailsuspect@labanquepostale.fr.

# How do I secure my account after suspected fraud?
Immediately change your password on a secure device, review transactions, and contact the fraud department. Update your secure phone number and request new credentials if needed. File a fraud claim to investigate unauthorized transactions.

# How do I activate my secured phone number?
Go to your account’s security settings, select “link/modify phone number,” then follow SMS instructions.

# Can Certicode Plus be used for joint accounts?
Yes. Each joint account holder must individually meet the security requirements.
