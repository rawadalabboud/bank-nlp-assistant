# How can I check my account balance?
You can check your balance in the Online Customer Area or the mobile app. Balances are updated in real time.

# How do I open a bank account?
You can apply online or at a post office. Provide valid ID and proof of address. Once approved, you will receive your account details and card.

# What is the account balance?
The account balance shows the money available after processed transactions. Pending payments (checks, card operations) may not be visible immediately.

# How do I get a bank statement or RIB?
Log into your Online Area → Accounts → Download/Print RIB. In the app, use “Share RIB” or “Download RIB”.

# I’ve lost my login credentials — what do I do?
Use “Forgot username/password” on the login page. Temporary credentials are sent via SMS or post, then set a new password. If stolen, call support to block access.

# Card swallowed by an ATM
If an ATM keeps your card, note the ATM location and time. Contact the ATM owner (the bank displayed on the machine) and La Banque Postale support. Place your card in opposition if you can’t recover it quickly. A replacement card can be ordered from your Customer Area or by your advisor.
