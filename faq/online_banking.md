# How do I log in to my Online Customer Space?
Go to the website or app → “Access my accounts”. Enter username + password. First login uses temporary password sent by mail.

# I can’t access my account — what should I do?
Check credentials, update browser, clear cache. Use “Forgot password” if needed. Contact support if problem persists.

# How can I update my personal info?
In Online Area → Profile → Personal Information. Update address, email, phone. Some changes need SMS code validation.
